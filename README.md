## Pre-trained Weights
Please look at the release page for the pre-trained model weights of three experiments and the missing [DepthAny v1](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything) package.

## Installation and Data Preparation
Please refer to [Lepard](https://github.com/rabbityl/lepard) and [2D3D-MATR](https://github.com/minhaolee/2D3DMATR).

Our 2D3D registration code  is based on [2D3D-MATR](https://github.com/minhaolee/2D3DMATR), and 3d registration code is based on [Lepard](https://github.com/rabbityl/lepard).
