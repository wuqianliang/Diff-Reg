ðŸ‘€ If you have any questions, please let me (wuqianliang@njust.edu.cn) know~

## Pre-trained Weights
Please look at the [release](https://github.com/wuqianliang/Diff-Reg/releases/tag/DiffRegv1) page for the pre-trained model weights of three experiments.
## Installation
1. Please use the NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU.
2. Utilize the 'Diff-Reg-2d3d/eccv24_2d3d_env.yml', 'Diff-Reg-3dmatch/eccv24_3d_env.yml', 'Diff-Reg-4dmatch/eccv24_4d_env.yml' to install environments.
   
## Data Preparation
Please refer to [Lepard](https://github.com/rabbityl/lepard) and [2D3D-MATR](https://github.com/minhaolee/2D3DMATR).

Our 2D3D registration code  is based on [2D3D-MATR](https://github.com/minhaolee/2D3DMATR), and 3d registration code is based on [Lepard](https://github.com/rabbityl/lepard).
